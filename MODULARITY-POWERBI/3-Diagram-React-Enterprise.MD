Here's the diagram illustrating **Enterprise Integration Strategies** with ReactJS and Node.js. The key components and their interactions are:

1. **ReactJS Frontend**:
   - Communicates with the Node.js backend via REST/GraphQL APIs.
   - Directly embeds PowerBI dashboards for data visualization.
   - Fetches data from cloud services or external APIs for additional functionality.

2. **Node.js Backend**:
   - Handles API requests and processes data from SQL Server.
   - Manages authentication via LDAP/Active Directory (AD).
   - Acts as the central hub for data flow and logic.

3. **PowerBI**:
   - Integrated with ReactJS for enterprise-level analytics dashboards.

4. **SQL Server Database**:
   - Stores and retrieves application data through secure queries.

5. **Authentication Service (LDAP/AD)**:
   - Authenticates users and enforces role-based access controls (RBAC).

6. **Cloud Services or APIs**:
   - Provides additional data or services accessed by the ReactJS frontend.

This diagram represents a modular and adaptable architecture, demonstrating how each component integrates seamlessly for enterprise flexibility. Let me know if you'd like further elaboration or changes!
