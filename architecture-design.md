# **DYS Solution: Architecture and Security Design**

## **1. Overview**

The DYS Solution is designed to provide a secure, modular, and scalable system for handling sensitive youth services data. This architecture separates roles and responsibilities across servers to minimize the attack surface while maintaining compliance with security standards like OWASP and NIST.

---

## **2. Architecture Design**

### **2.1 Components**
1. **SQL Server (Sensitive Data)**:
   - The source of truth for all production data.
   - Restricted access; only the Dev Server can query this server.
2. **Dev Server (Node.js + SQLite)**:
   - Pulls data from SQL Server.
   - Encrypts data into JSON files.
   - Stages and tests updates using SQLite as a lightweight local database.
   - Pushes JSON files to Prod and Public Servers.
3. **JSON Files (Encrypted)**:
   - Temporarily stored on the Dev Server for staging and testing.
   - Used by Prod and Public Servers for serving data.
4. **Prod Server (Node.js Backend)**:
   - Hosts private, secure pages for internal users.
   - Consumes encrypted JSON files for dynamic content.
5. **Public Server (Static Hosting)**:
   - Serves static files and encrypted JSON files for public-facing content.
   - No database access to reduce risk.
6. **Secrets Manager**:
   - Centralized management of API keys and encryption keys.
   - Ensures secure storage and retrieval of sensitive information.

### **2.2 Data Flow**
```plaintext
1. SQL Server â†’ Dev Server: Pulls sensitive data securely.
2. Dev Server â†’ JSON Files: Encrypts and stages data for testing.
3. Dev Server â†’ Prod/Public Servers: Pushes JSON files securely.
4. Secrets Manager â†’ All Servers: Provides API keys and encryption keys as needed.
```

---

## **3. Security Measures**

### **3.1 Encryption**
1. **Data at Rest**:
   - All JSON files are encrypted using AES-256.
   - Example encryption flow:
     ```javascript
     const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-cbc', key, iv);
     const encrypted = cipher.update(data, 'utf8', 'hex') + cipher.final('hex');
     ```

2. **Data in Transit**:
   - Uses HTTPS or SFTP for secure data transmission.
   - Example: SFTP file transfer from Dev to Public Server:
     ```bash
     scp data.json.enc user@publicserver:/var/www/data/
     ```

### **3.2 Authentication and Access Control**
1. **Environment Isolation**:
   - SQL Server is only accessible to the Dev Server.
   - No database access for Public Server.
2. **Secrets Management**:
   - API keys and encryption keys are stored in a Secrets Manager.
   - Example: AWS Secrets Manager fetch:
     ```javascript
     const secretsManager = new AWS.SecretsManager();
     secretsManager.getSecretValue({ SecretId: 'EncryptionKey' }, callback);
     ```

---

## **4. Compliance**
### **4.1 OWASP Standards**
- **Secure Data Handling**:
  - All sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
- **Access Control**:
  - Role-based access for each server ensures minimal exposure.
- **Logging and Monitoring**:
  - Logs are maintained for server access, data transfers, and encryption operations.

### **4.2 NIST Compliance**
- **Data Encryption**:
  - AES-256 is used, meeting FIPS 140-2 requirements.
- **Key Management**:
  - Secrets Manager handles secure key storage and rotation.

---

## **5. Addressing Foreseen Questions**

### **5.1 Network and Data Flow**
1. **How are servers connected?**
   - SQL Server and Dev Server communicate over a private VPN or restricted network.
   - JSON files are pushed securely to Prod and Public Servers.

2. **Why does the Public Server not access the database?**
   - This minimizes the attack surface and ensures the public-facing server is lightweight and secure.

---

### **5.2 Security Concerns**
1. **How is sensitive data protected?**
   - Data is encrypted immediately upon generation.
   - Encrypted JSON files are transferred and served securely.

2. **What happens if a server is compromised?**
   - Public Server has no direct access to sensitive data or databases.
   - Dev Server encrypts all data, so no plaintext is exposed.

---

### **5.3 Scalability**
1. **How does the system handle increased traffic?**
   - Public Server serves pre-generated static files, making it inherently scalable.
   - JSON file generation can be optimized for increased data volumes.

---

## **6. Operational Workflow**

### **6.1 Data Generation**
- Dev Server queries SQL Server daily or on-demand to fetch updated data.

### **6.2 Data Processing**
- Data is encrypted and stored as JSON files.
- Files are tested locally on the Dev Server using SQLite.

### **6.3 Deployment**
- JSON files are securely pushed to Prod and Public Servers.

### **6.4 Logging and Monitoring**
- All file transfers, encryption operations, and key accesses are logged.
