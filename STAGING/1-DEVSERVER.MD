A **DHS Security-focused presentation**, emphasize how the application’s infrastructure, development environment, and deployment processes adhere to best practices for security and compliance. Let’s start with **Development Server Setup**.

---

## **Presentation Outline: Security and Development Environment**

### 1. **Introduction**
   - **Objective**: Present the development server setup and application architecture, focusing on security measures and how it aligns with DHS policies.
   - **Scope**: Highlight:
     - Development server details.
     - Security protocols for the application and server.
     - Plans for securing the production environment.

---

### 2. **Development Server Setup**

**Environment Overview**:
- **Server Type**: Microsoft Windows Server VM provided by DHS IT.
- **Role of the Server**:
  - Acts as an isolated environment for building, testing, and reviewing the DYS Solution before public deployment.
  - Provides a secure space to evaluate features and conduct internal audits.

**Key Components Installed**:
- **Node.js & Express**:
  - Backend framework for serving the application.
  - Installed via official Node.js LTS version to ensure long-term support and stability.
- **Database**:
  - Connected to DHS’s SQL Server instance for consistency with production environments.
- **HTTPS Certificates**:
  - Using DHS-approved Certificate Authority (CA) for secure encrypted communication.
- **PM2 Process Manager**:
  - Installed to manage Node.js processes:
    - Ensures app reliability by automatically restarting on crashes.
    - Enables clustering to utilize multiple CPU cores.

**Firewall and Access Control**:
- Restricted access to the development server:
  - Accessible only via VPN or DHS internal network.
  - SSH and RDP limited to specific IP ranges.

**Security Measures**:
1. **Regular Updates**:
   - Automated patches for Windows Server.
   - Node.js and dependencies audited using `npm audit`.
2. **Log Management**:
   - All server and application logs stored in a secure, DHS-monitored location.
   - Real-time monitoring tools (e.g., Splunk or ELK Stack) integrated for anomaly detection.

### 3. **Application Security Features**

**Frontend (ReactJS + TypeScript)**:
- **Input Validation**:
  - All user inputs validated client-side and server-side to prevent injection attacks.
- **Dynamic Component Isolation**:
  - React components are modular, reducing the risk of cross-component data leaks.

**Backend (Node.js + Express)**:
- **Data Validation**:
  - Middleware implemented to sanitize and validate incoming data.
  - Protects against SQL injection and data tampering.
- **CSRF Protection**:
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens used for all forms and sensitive actions.
- **Session Management**:
  - Sessions secured using signed and encrypted cookies.
  - Strict `SameSite` policies enforced.

**Database Layer (SQL Server)**:
- **Access Control**:
  - Uses least privilege principles for database user roles.
  - Separate read/write users to minimize attack surface.
- **Data Encryption**:
  - All sensitive data encrypted at rest (SQL Server Transparent Data Encryption) and in transit (TLS).
- **Audit Logging**:
  - All database interactions logged for forensic analysis.

**General Security Practices**:
1. **Dependencies**:
   - Regular audits with tools like Snyk and `npm audit`.
   - Pinning dependency versions to avoid supply chain attacks.
2. **Rate Limiting and DDoS Protection**:
   - Middleware to limit the number of requests per user/IP.
   - Cloud-based DDoS protection (e.g., Cloudflare) in staging and production environments.

### 4. **HTTPS Configuration**

**Certificate Management**:
- Certificates provided by DHS IT or generated using internal Certificate Authority.
- Installed on the development server using the `https` module in Node.js.

**Implementation**:
1. Node.js server configured with:
   - Private key and public certificate.
   - Strong TLS configuration (TLS 1.2/1.3 only, disabling weak ciphers).
2. IIS Reverse Proxy:
   - Configured as a reverse proxy for Node.js, leveraging IIS’s HTTPS termination capabilities.

**Secure Headers**:
- Configured HTTP response headers:
  - `Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)`: Enforces HTTPS connections.
  - `Content-Security-Policy (CSP)`: Restricts sources for scripts, styles, and media.
  - `X-Frame-Options`: Prevents clickjacking.
  - `X-Content-Type-Options`: Reduces MIME-type sniffing risks.

### 5. **Production Environment Preview**

**Transition to Production**:
- **Environment Isolation**:
  - Development and production environments kept completely isolated.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - Automated deployment pipelines to ensure secure and seamless updates.
  - All builds tested and reviewed before deployment.

**Production Server Security**:
- Similar setup as the development server but with additional safeguards:
  - Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block malicious traffic.
  - Regular penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.

---

### 6. **Next Steps**

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Confirm development server access configurations.
  - Schedule an internal security audit.
- **Future Plans**:
  - Build production environment adhering to the same security standards.
  - Integrate DHS’s authentication system (e.g., Active Directory) for production.

---

## **What You’ll Need to Do:**
1. **Create Supporting Visuals**:
   - Diagram the server setup, showing how Node.js, PM2, IIS, and HTTPS certificates interact.
   - Highlight the flow of data between frontend, backend, and database layers.

2. **Prepare a Demo**:
   - Show the development server in action.
   - Walk through the HTTPS setup and middleware for request validation.

3. **Provide Documentation**:
   - Create a handout with the outlined security measures for the CSO to review later.
