Diagram illustrating a PM2 setup for a Node.js application. It shows:

1. **Client Requests**: Incoming traffic distributed across multiple Node.js application instances.
2. **Node.js Application Instances**: Multiple instances running in parallel to utilize multi-core CPUs.
3. **PM2 Process Manager**: Centralized management of these instances, ensuring process restarts, monitoring, and clustering.
4. **Database or External Services**: Connection to databases or external APIs for data handling.

This setup highlights how PM2 ensures scalability and reliability by managing multiple application instances efficiently. Let me know if youâ€™d like additional details or tweaks!
