### **Why AES-256-GCM is Preferred**
AES-256-GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) is the preferred encryption standard in modern cryptographic practices due to its enhanced security features compared to CBC (Cipher Block Chaining): 
**Recommendation**: Wherever possible, use AES-256-GCM instead of AES-256-CBC for encrypting sensitive data to align with modern cryptographic standards and enhance security.
  1. **Built-In Integrity Verification**:
     - GCM includes an **authentication tag** that ensures both the confidentiality and integrity of the encrypted data.
     - This eliminates the need for a separate message authentication code (MAC), reducing complexity and potential vulnerabilities.

  2. **Parallelizable for Performance**:
     - GCM allows for faster encryption and decryption as it supports parallel processing of blocks, making it more efficient for high-throughput applications.

  3. **Resilience Against Padding Attacks**:
     - Unlike CBC, GCM does not require padding, reducing the risk of padding oracle attacks.

  4. **Standards Compliance**:
     - AES-GCM is recommended by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) for applications requiring high levels of security and performance.

  5. **Ease of Use**:
     - The inclusion of an **authentication tag** simplifies secure transmission of encrypted data, ensuring tamper-proof communication.
